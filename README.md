<h2> Abstract : </h2>
<p>
  Natural language Processing (NLP) is the fledgling field of computer comprehension and analysis of human language. One of the worldâ€™s most multilingual and multicultural countries is India. Given that Indians live in different regions and
  speak different regional languages, the country has the second-highest number of languages in the world. Whereas in India English is offered as the second language. But India uses little English, which creates a communication barrier. It
  is nearly difficult for the people to fill this language gap by converting one language into another, but it can be accomplished through Machine Translation (MT). The primary goal of this paper is to translate Indian languages using
  neural networks translating Hindi into English and vice versa, with the help of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and sequence to sequence model with an encoder-decoder attention mechanism is put forth.
